Companies often generalize their products or services in the website copy, making it hard to understand what it is the customer is actually paying for. Sometimes, businesses are afraid that the literal explanations of their products aren't interesting enough or will sound unappealing in writing. And that's a fair concern.
                    However, investing just a sentence or two into telling your potential customers exactly what they'll receive can keep them on your website for longer and get them interested in learning more.</p>
